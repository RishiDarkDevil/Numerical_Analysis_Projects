# Numerical Analysis Projects
I worked on all of the above Projects as a Part of my Course Curriculum of Numerical Analysis in my 1st Year, 2nd Semester.\
Here I have learnt about several techniques and algorithms along with their practical applications.\
I made awesome Physics Simulations and also used various techniques to fit models to data. I have done the following things, mostly, across all the above mini-projects:
- Solving Ordinary Differential Equations using iterative techniques like Taylor's Method and more advanced Runge-Kutta Method. I did physics simulation involving Elastic Pendulum, Gravity Well ball trajectory.
- Fitting MLE Distribution to Biostatistics Data.
- Matrix Algorithms: QR Decomposition, Gauss-Jordan Elimination, LU Decomposition.
- Finite Element Methods Modeling of Soap Film on a Frame of any shape.
- Polynomial Interpolation.

**NOTE**: Since, most of the Projects include interactive plots, animations, etc. they can't be viewed directly on github. Hence, `.html` files need to be downloaded and viewed locally or you may view the github pages deployment of this repo to skip downloading.
