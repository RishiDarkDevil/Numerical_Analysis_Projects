# Numerical Analysis Projects
I worked on all of the above Projects as a Part of my Course Curriculum of Numerical Analysis in my 1st Year, 2nd Semester.\
Here I have learnt about several techniques and algorithms along with their practical applications.\
I made awesome Physics Simulations and also used various techniques to fit models to data. It was really fun to work through them, and they were challenging at times(Like the Finite Elements Method for Soap Film Simulation). All together the final outcomes of the projects were quite satisfying.

Note: Since, most of the Projects include interactive plots, animations, etc. they can't be viewed directly on github. Hence, `.html` files need to be downloaded and viewed locally.
